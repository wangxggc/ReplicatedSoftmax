# ReplicatedSoftmax

Basic untested version of Replicated Softmax:

	@inproceedings{hinton2009replicated,
	  title={Replicated softmax: an undirected topic model},
	  author={Hinton, Geoffrey E and Salakhutdinov, Ruslan R},
	  booktitle={Advances in neural information processing systems},
	  pages={1607--1614},
	  year={2009}
	}

based on Theano RBM implementation from deeplearning.net.

To test download the matlab preprocessed dataset from [20Newsgroups](http://qwone.com/~jason/20Newsgroups/) and put it in the appropriate folder (see below).

This implementation is supposed to provide a framework for further work on RSM,
not just the good results right away.
